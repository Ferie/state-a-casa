# State a casa

This is a multi language exercise I did during the big lockdown of 2020.

## Description

This HTML page is showing full screen, the message "Stay at home" depending on the main language of your broser.

The message is responsive (mobile, portrait and landscape resolutions, and desktop resolutions) and the background randomly changes every time the page is reloaded.

## Available languages

The message is translated in the following languages:

- Italian
- English
- German
- Spanish
- Portuguese
- French
- Polish
- Russian
- Turkish
- Greek
- Japanese
- Chinese
- Korean
- Indian
- Arabic

## Notes and support

In many cases, to translate the message, I have used Google translator: if you found some errors in the translations, please, feel free to open an issue or fix them in a PR.

If you want to add your own language, please, feel free to open an issue or a PR.
